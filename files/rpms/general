# [1] : some of installed tools have unversioned dependencies on this,
# but others have versioned (<=0.7).  So if a later version (0.7.1)
# gets installed in response to an unversioned dependency, it breaks.
# This pre-installs a compatible 0.6(ish) version from RHEL

# [2] : RHEL6 rpm versions of python-lxml is old, and has to be
# removed.  Several tools rely on it, so we install the dependencies
# pip needs to build it here (see tools/install_prereqs.sh)
